# Python Discovery Piscine

This repository contains my work from the **Python Discovery Piscine**, completed at the off-site campus **Forty2** in France. The piscine introduced me to the fundamentals of Python through 8 structured modules (00 - 07), each containing several exercises designed to build my understanding of the language.

This was a great introduction to Python, helping me build a strong foundation for future projects!
